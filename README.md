Project Deliverable for SWENG 861:
Option 1- You will develop a software that will provide the end-user with the functionality to inquire about a song or a singer. 
A user may input a song title/singer name. This service can be accessed via a web interface or REST API Client or REST API Testing tools. 
The program will output information regarding the input. If a song title, then the output may include: singer name, composer name, date of release, lyrics, etc.
